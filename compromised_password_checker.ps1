    .SYNOPSIS
        A functional version of the Compromised Password Checker script for Password Manager
        that uses the FREE HaveIBeenPwned PwnedPasswords API as an alternative to the default
        solution, VeriClouds CredVerify (https://www.vericlouds.com/oneidentity/).

    .DESCRIPTION
        This script is an alternative version of the One Identity Password Manager
        compromised_password_checker.ps1 script that is run when the extensibility setting
        "Credential Checker on" is enabled. This script utilizes the completely free PwnedPasswords
        API provided by HaveIBeenPwned.com.

        The function names, parameters, and outputs are required by PWM and HIBP and should
        not be modified.

        To use:
        Overwrite the original "compromised_password_checker.ps1" file in the
        Service\Resources\CredentialChecker directory of your Password Manager Installation
        The default location is:
        C:\Program Files\One Identity\Password Manager\Service\Resources\CredentialChecker

#>

function Get-HashAlgorithm
{   
    # Default function used by PWM on the backend. HIBP uses SHA-1.

    return "SHA1"

}

<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Confirm-PwnedPassword
        
        Checks the HaveIBeenPwned Password Database to determine if a password has been pwned

    .DESCRIPTION
        If a password has been compromised according to the HaveIBeenPwned database, this
        function will return $true. Otherwise, $false.

        This function can either take a plaintext password, which it will hash automatically,
        or a pre-computed password hash. The HIBP API expects passwords hashed via SHA-1.

        When making the API request, this function sends only the first 5 characters of the hash,
        per the HIBP API guidelines to utilize its secure k-anonimity model.

        [parameter(position=1,mandatory,ParameterSetName="Plaintext")]

        $PlaintextPassword,

        [parameter(position=1,mandatory,ParameterSetName="Hash")]

    }

    # HIBP uses the first 5 characters of the hash for its Range check
    # See details here: https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange
    $hashPrefix = $HashedPassword.Substring(0,5)

    # The -UseBasicParsing parameter bypasses the need to setup IE's initial config
    $HIBP = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -UseBasicParsing

    # The HIBP API returns a CRLF separated string with all matching hashes
    # but only includes the SUFFIX (all characters after the 5 we provide)
    # and also includes the count of compromises, separated by a colon
    # example ABCDEFGHIJKLMN: 24

    # Here we loop through that list, parse out the suffixes, and return an object
    # containing all the complete hashes (forced to lowercase)
    $HashMatches = ForEach ($result in $HIBP.Content.Split("`n")) {
        
        $hashSuffix = $Result.Split(":")[0].ToLower()
        "$hashPrefix$hashSuffix"

    }

    $PasswordLeaked = ($HashedPassword.ToLower() -in $HashMatches)

    Return $PasswordLeaked
}

function Test-IsCompromisedCredential
{

    # The other default function used on the backend. PWM hashes the password itself 
    # using the algorithm returned from the above Get-HashAlgorithm function above and
    # passes that in for the $passwordHash parameter.

    # username is in the OOTB function, so it was left as a non-mandatory
    # parameter, but is not needed for the HIBP API call. Some services, like VeriClouds Credverify
    # include an option to check if the entire Credential Pair is compromised vs. just the password.
    # Both the default CredVerify integration and this HIBP integration currently just check the password.

    param(

        [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]        
        [string]
        $username,

        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]        
        [string]
